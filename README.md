Credit Scoring Model
Welcome to the Credit Scoring Model repository! This project, completed during my CodeAlpha internship, involves building a machine learning model to classify individuals' creditworthiness based on their financial data. The goal is to aid in making informed credit decisions and assessing financial risk more accurately.

Files in this repository:
codealpha_credit_scoring_model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

train.csv: Dataset with features such as transaction history, loan payments, credit history, income levels, and other financial metrics used for training and testing the model.
